## Recommended Development Workflow

### Building with AI Coding Agents

This starter kit is designed to work seamlessly with AI coding agents like **Claude Code**. For the best development experience, we recommend following the **[BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)** (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI Driven Development).

**What is BMAD?**

The BMAD Method is a comprehensive framework that combines human expertise with AI capabilities to build software more effectively. It provides:

- **19+ specialized AI agents** and **50+ workflows** for different development scenarios
- **Three planning tracks** that automatically adapt based on your project needs:
  - **Quick Flow Track** - Bug fixes and small features
  - **BMad Method Track** - Full products and platforms (recommended for this starter kit)
  - **Enterprise Method Track** - Complex systems with security and compliance needs

**Why BMAD with this Starter Kit?**

- Accelerates feature development while maintaining code quality
- Provides structured workflows for common tasks (auth, database, UI components)
- Helps AI agents understand your project structure and patterns
- Guides reflective thinking that brings out better architectural decisions

**Getting Started with BMAD:**

1. Review the [BMAD Method documentation](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)
2. Use the `CLAUDE.md` file in this repo (pre-configured for Claude Code)
3. Follow the BMad Method Track for adding new features to your application

> **Note**: While BMAD is recommended, it's entirely optional. This starter kit works great with any development workflow or AI coding assistant.

pnpm run dev:frontend     # Run Next.js only
pnpm run dev:backend      # Run Convex only
pnpm run predev           # Convex dev + auto-open dashboard

# Building
pnpm run build            # Build Next.js for production
pnpm run start            # Start production server

# Code Quality
pnpm run lint             # Run ESLint

# Testing
pnpm run test             # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm run test:once        # Run tests once
pnpm run test:debug       # Debug tests with inspector
pnpm run test:coverage    # Run with coverage report
```

### Adding New Features

```bash
# Add a new shadcn/ui component
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]

# Generate Convex types (after schema changes)
npx convex codegen

# Open Convex dashboard
npx convex dashboard
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for Next.js (auto-generated by Convex):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
```

Set Convex environment variables:

```bash
npx convex env set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET $(openssl rand -base64 32)
npx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000
```

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for all available variables.

---

## Testing

This starter includes a complete testing setup with Vitest and convex-test:

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm run test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
pnpm run test:once

# Run with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage
```

**Example test structure:**

- `convex/myFunctions.test.ts` - Example Convex function tests
- Tests run in isolated environment with mock database
- See [convex/TESTING.md](./convex/TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing guide

**Key patterns:**

```typescript
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { modules } from "./test.setup";
import schema from "./schema";

it("should test something", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema, modules);
  const result = await t.query(api.myFunctions.listNumbers, { count: 10 });
  expect(result.numbers).toEqual([]);
});
```

---

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend**

   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js

3. **Deploy Backend**

   ```bash
   npx convex deploy
   ```

4. **Set Production Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   npx convex env set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET $(openssl rand -base64 32) --prod
   npx convex env set SITE_URL https://your-domain.vercel.app --prod
   ```

5. **Update Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` with your production Convex URL

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions, custom domains, and other platforms.
